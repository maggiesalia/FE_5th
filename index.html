                Not every idea was a home run. Storm Thorgerson apparently
                suggested a close-up of a baboon's anus for "Meddle,' before being
                thankfully overruled by Pink Floyd. They instead suggested a photo
                of an ear underwater, and Hipgnosis dispatched photographer Bob
                Dowling. Not every idea was a home run. Storm Thorgerson apparently

                This iconic image grew out of an initial comment to Hipgnosis
              designers from keyboardist Richard Wright: "Ugh, do we have to
              have one of your bloody surreal designs again?" Before they
              settled on the prism effect, the firm also considered using a
              Silver Surfer-type character. This iconic image grew out of an initial comment to Hipgnosis

                A gust of wind blew flames from stuntman Ronnie Rondell's
              flame-retardant suit back into his face on the 15th attempt to
              complete this shoot – prompting the onsite team to douse him with
              extinguishing foam. Luckily, Aubrey Powell already had the final
              image. A gust of wind blew flames from stuntman Ronnie Rondell's
